                <h1>WEBSITE REPORT</h1>
                The main structure of the website is a grid with 3 columns designed with a navigation bar on the left edge of the screen that gives access to 5 webpages (Home, Portofolio, CV, Contact, Website Report), header at the very top, a side bar with quick links on the right edge, a main body for the content and footer at the bottom with icons linked to my social media profiles. I chose the grids this way to make the page look clean, the nav and the siderbar only take 20% of the screen width which leaves a lot of space for the main content.
                I chose a simple gray pattern background with black text, an intelligible font and I created border frames for the grid elements and added them an opacity effect (I used background-color: rgba – opacity makes all the elements transparent instead of just the frames). I used the same layout across all pages so it adds to the fluidity of the browsing and made the website compatible with mobile devices and also added a “hamburger” icon to improve the user experience on a wider range of devices.
                The Home page has an “Intro” and a “Purpose” section which includes a bio and a status box.
                In the Portofolio page I placed dummy images in a 3x3 table – later on they will be changed with Achievments and Memories images.
                In the CV page I have also included a link which switches the content of the page to either CV or Personal Statement. 
                The Contact page shows my contact information and it features a contact form. The “Submit” button also opens the default email app and fills the details provided.
                Site Report page contains a log (my experience on the module), the Website Report and screenshots – including code validation.

                The Web-Development module provides students with the required skills to create, customize and implement a website. It also teaches you about Internet, generally, from browsers and servers to development environments like CSS and JavaScript.
                The first lesson we had covered all the basics and was easy to understand. Some topics were a bit challenging but I practiced on the exercises provided and managed to keep up, I even won a fair amount of Kahoot! Quiz Tests, which is one of the easiest way of learning and catching up with material. The tests only took 20 minutes and we had the chance to compete with other students in a fun way and also to learn while analysing the answers.
                I also learned about tools like GitHub, which is a must-have skill in IT industry. It helpee sd me a lot in the assignment, I managed to sync it in cloud, to keep it safe, up to date and I was handy to have when I was experiencing with code and design decisions. Mastering the use of GitHub services can definitely boost productivity.
                I appreciate that we don’t have to study code that was used 10-15 years ago and we focus more on new, up to date methods. 
                Overall, CSY-1018 was my favourite module this term and it’s the course I enjoy the most improving on. I liked that the teacher found a way to keep the course interactive, using the Kahoot! Quiz, especially in the online class environment. I’ve been following the course for only 3 months and I’m able to build and design a website from the bottom to an average state. Now I’m really intrigued to find out what’s the next term’s material.
